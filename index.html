                                <p>It all started at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. I was studying Computer Engineering while she was studying Psychology. We didn't know it yet, but our lives were about to change forever. Walking from the bus to the commune where we were staying, fate had other plans.</p>

                                <p>I remember coming to her room, and we danced together. In that moment, I felt something I'd never felt before. It wasn't just attraction—it was a connection, a feeling that this person would become the most important part of my life. We got to know each other, and with every conversation, I fell deeper.</p>

                                <p>She moved to Pietermaritzburg to pursue nursing, and I was still at UKZN completing my degree. The distance was hard, but our love only grew stronger. Despite being apart, our bond became unbreakable. We knew this was meant to be.</p>

                                <p>When I moved to Johannesburg for my job, everyone said long distance wouldn't work. But they didn't understand what we had. Every single day, my love for her grew more and more. Distance means nothing when your heart is with someone. We continued, we persevered, and our love only became deeper and stronger.</p>
